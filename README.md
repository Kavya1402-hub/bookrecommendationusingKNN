What is this project about?

This project is about how computers help people find books they will like.

It works just like a librarian who suggests books based on what you have read before!

It uses a special method called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find books similar to the ones you like.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
ðŸ‘‰ Imagine you love reading Harry Potter. The system will recommend books like:
âœ… Percy Jackson
âœ… The Hobbit
âœ… The Chronicles of Narnia

It works like a smart friend who knows what books you might enjoy!
